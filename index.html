  	     <h2> My different trips üåç</h2>
         <p> 
	     I did a lot of travelling during my youth thanks to my parents who passed on their passion. These adventures allowed me to acquire a certain open-mindedness but it especially allowed me to discover my passion for cultural differences. My double nationality surely helped me to grow up with a French father and a Swedish mother.  
	      Here is a small list of my trips: 
	     <ul> 
		   <li> Sweden </li>
		   <li> Iceland </li>
		   <li> Germany </li>
		   <li> Portugal </li>
		   <li> Spain </li>
		   <li> England </li>
           <li> Belgium </li>
		   <li> Netherland </li>
		   <li> Austria </li>

  	     <h2> My favorite sports ‚öΩ</h2>
         <p> 
	     I am a passionate of Sports. I've been doing it all my life and it's not going to stop! I started with fencing and it immediately became my favorite sport, I've been doing it since I was 6 years old and I love competing at a high level both individually and as a team. I also did 4 years of tennis and I love Formula 1. I am also very interested in basketball and soccer even if my level is not great.

  	     <h2> The self development </h2>
         <p>
 	     Self development refers to the process of  improving one's abilities, knowledge, and character, with the goal of reaching one's full potential and leading a fulfilling life. It involves continuous learning, reflection, and personal growth, and encompasses various aspects such as emotional intelligence, physical health, relationships, career, and spirituality. Self development is important because it leads to increased self-awareness, better decision-making, improved relationships, and greater life satisfaction. It also enables individuals to become their best version, leading to a more fulfilling and successful life
